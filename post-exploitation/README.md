# Post-Exploitation

This section outlines the post-exploitation activities performed after gaining initial access during the authorized penetration test.  
All actions described here are **purely educational**, fully **sanitized**, and executed in an **isolated lab environment**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives of Post-Exploitation
The primary goals during post-exploitation include:

1. **Validating the level of access obtained**  
   - Confirming shell access  
   - Enumerating user permissions  

2. **Determining the value of compromised systems**  
   - Identifying accessible data  
   - Testing lateral movement possibilities (conceptually only)  

3. **Assessing escalation paths**  
   - Privilege escalation vectors  
   - Weak configurations  
   - Mismanaged permissions  

---

## 🔍 Privilege Escalation (Conceptual Overview)
Only safe, non-destructive enumeration was performed, including:

- Checking OS version and kernel  
- Reviewing SUID/SGID binaries  
- Enumerating installed packages  
- Inspecting scheduled tasks  
- Reviewing user and group permissions  

⚠️ *No harmful or automated exploit scripts are included.*

## 🔒 Persistence (High-Level Concept Only)
Documented for educational purposes:

- Misconfiguration-based persistence  
- Weak credential reuse  
- Token/session reuse conditions  

Again — **no persistent access was established** in the real environment.
