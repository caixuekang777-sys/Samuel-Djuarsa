# Exploitation

This section documents the exploitation phase of the engagement.  
All screenshots, outputs, and commands used here have been **fully sanitized** and were performed only in an **authorized lab environment**.

## 🔐 Exploitation Strategy
During this phase, the following high-level actions were performed:

1. **Identifying viable attack vectors**  
   - Based on open ports, services, and known vulnerabilities  
   - Validating findings using public CVE references  

2. **Crafting proof-of-concept exploitation steps**  
   - Input validation bypass  
   - Authentication weaknesses  
   - Misconfiguration exploitation  

3. **Executing controlled exploitation attempts**  
   - Only within the approved test scope  
   - Ensuring no destructive actions  
   - Capturing sanitized output for documentation
